            <p>Internet Provider Tester</p>
            <p>In the realm of modern connectivity, a stable internet connection is often taken for granted until it falters. However, for those who rely heavily on a consistent online presence, even minor disruptions can cause significant inconvenience. In such scenarios, effectively communicating the issue to internet service providers can be challenging, especially when intermittent disruptions defy easy diagnosis. To address this challenge, I developed a simple yet effective application during instances of frustrating internet interruptions. With a primary objective of demonstrating the intermittent nature of the connection to my internet service provider, the application serves as a tangible proof of the connectivity issues experienced.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="p-3">
            <p>The application, crafted in PowerShell, operates on a straightforward principle: to periodically send a ping request to a reliable external source, such as Google. By monitoring the response to these ping requests, the application discerns whether the internet connection is intact or has faltered.</p>
            <p>At its core, the application executes a ping command to Google every minute, gauging the responsiveness of the internet connection. Upon receiving a successful response, the application logs the event as "connected," signifying the presence of a stable connection. Conversely, when the ping request fails to elicit a response, the application registers the event as "disconnected," indicating a lapse in connectivity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="p-3 ">
            <p>To provide a comprehensive overview of the connectivity status over time, the application incorporates timestamping for each recorded event. This feature not only aids in pinpointing the timing of disruptions but also facilitates communication with the internet service provider by presenting a clear timeline of events.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the application includes a counter functionality, enabling users to track the duration of disconnections accurately. By tallying the consecutive minutes of downtime, users gain insights into the frequency and duration of connectivity lapses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="p-3">
            <p>Upon execution, the application launches a terminal window, offering real-time visibility into connectivity events. Simultaneously, all logged events, including timestamps and connection status, are meticulously cataloged in a file named "logs.txt," residing in the same directory as the application. This dual approach ensures accessibility and persistence of connectivity data for further analysis or communication with the internet service provider.</p>
            <p>In essence, this application serves as a practical tool for elucidating the intermittent nature of internet connectivity issues. By providing tangible evidence through comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring, it empowers users to advocate for improved service reliability and expedited issue resolution from their internet service providers.</p>
